### Grandpa's Coin Store
My Grandfather has been an avid coin collector for a large part of his life. At this point his hobby has turned into business, but its hard work to sell coins. He has to go to coin shows every weekend to sell them, and that isn't easy. But he needs this money to stay afloat, so I thought I'd take this opportunity to help him sell his coins, and also gain new experience.

### Tech Stack
For this project I decided to go with **next.js**, and use vercel to deploy the project. The project is being written in **typescript** instead of **javascript**. This is because I prefer typed languages as compared to untyped languages. For user auth I went with kinde-auth. Kinde-auth keeps track of user login information, it also tracks SSO session managment, and tokenz for authorization. I store the data for the coins on supabase, using the buckets for the coin images. For interacting with the database I went with prisma ORM.
